// What are the advantages of using promises instead of callbacks?

/*
why are we use promise- to manage asyncronous actions in javascript

.... there are 3 part in promise
1- fullfilled
2- rejected
3-pending

...we are use promise instead of callback beause of promise has better machanism 
to track the asyncronous action and better error handling mechanism.

promise.then(function()
{
    console.log('hii..)
}).catch(function()
{
    console.log('bye)
})
